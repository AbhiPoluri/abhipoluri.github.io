## Introduction

I utilised NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) in python to create an evolving AI that plays until it becomes too advanced to lose. I followed a tutorial which taught me how the algorithim works and how to use it in other projects. This project taught me how to use the pygame library and how to use the NEAT library. I also learnt how to use the pickle library to save the best AI's weights and biases.

## What is NEAT? 

NEAT is a genetic algorithm that uses a neural network to evolve a population of AI's to play a game. The AI's are given a fitness score based on how well they play the game. The AI's with the highest fitness score are then used to create the next generation of AI's. The AI's are given a random set of weights and biases to start with, and the AI's with the highest fitness score are given the best weights and biases. This process is repeated until the AI never loses.

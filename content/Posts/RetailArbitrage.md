In the beginning of the summer of 2022 I came across an amazon liquidation store called Krazy Bins. I was looking for a way to make some extra money and I thought this would be a good way to do it. I had no idea what I was doing but I was willing to learn. I started by buying a few items and selling them on FaceBook Marketplace. The first thing I bought were two sets of wrenches for $5 each and sold them for $120 total, I was hooked.

The rush I got from making my own money was unmatched and I wanted to do it more. I started to buy more and more items and I started to learn the ropes. I started to learn what items were worth buying and what items were not. I started to learn how to ship items and how to build an Ebay store. Soon I scaled the business and was raking in huge profit around $3-5k overall after running the business for less than 10 months. Since then I have invested the money and have been focusing on school. But every now and then I will drop by the local thrift store and maybe pick up a few items to sell on Ebay or FaceBook. I have learned a lot from this experience and I hope implement it into my life in the future.

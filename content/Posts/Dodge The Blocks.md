## Introduction

This is my first game, and I followed a tutorial to improve my knowledge of the C# programming language. This little project taught me how to work under time constraints and the value of solid level design. This project was done as a Genius Hour project, and I was required to write a reflection at the end of each work session. This taught me to finish my work and recognise what I learnt by completing it.

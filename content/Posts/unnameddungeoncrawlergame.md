This is my first game that i made without following a tutorial. I made this game to learn how to use the Unity Engine and C# programming language. I specifically wanted to learn more on Enemy behaviours and how to make a game that is fun to play. Some struggles I had were making my own sprites for the environment, players and enemies as I have never been the artistic type. So far I have successfully add a main menu, finished the player controller, added a health system, added an enemy behaviour, added a sound effect system, added bullet FX and finished the first level.

## Some short term goals I have are:

<ul>
<li>Finish second level</li>
<li>Create an enemy sprite</li>
<li><s>Add a pause menu</s></li>
<li><s>Add a game over screen</s></li>
<li>Create boss sprite and behaviour</li>
<li>Add an ingame shop for upgrades</li>
</ul>

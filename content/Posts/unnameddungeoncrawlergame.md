# First Post:

This is my first game that I made without following a tutorial. I made this game to learn how to use the Unity Engine and C# programming language. I specifically wanted to learn more on Enemy behaviours and how to make a game that is fun to play. Some struggles I had were making my own sprites for the environment, players and enemies as I have never been the artistic type. So far I have successfully add a main menu, finished the player controller, added a health system, added an enemy behaviour, added a sound effect system, added bullet FX and finished the first level.

## Some short term goals I have are:

<ul>
<li>Finish second level</li>
<li><s>Create an enemy sprite</s></li>
<li><s>Add a pause menu</s></li>
<li><s>Add a game over screen</s></li>
<li><s>Create boss sprite and behaviour</s></li>
</ul>

# Second Post:

I have added an Enemy Sprite and a Boss Sprite. I have also added a pause menu and a game over screen. I have also added a title screen a system to track how many kills the player has. I have nearly finsihed the second level. A big roadblock I am hitting is my artistic inability to counteract it I plan on hitting it as hard as i can and spending a few days on sprites alone to get them to a level I am happy with. I plan on changing the player sprite to have floating hands/gun reminiscent of Enter The Gungeon. 

#### Known Issues:

<ul>
<li>Boss doesnt spawn sometimes</li>
<li>Title-Screen looks like shit</li>
<li>Title-Screen doesnt work in WebGL</li>
</ul>

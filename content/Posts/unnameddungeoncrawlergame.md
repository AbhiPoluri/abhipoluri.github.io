# First Post:

This is my first game that I made without following a tutorial. I made this game to learn how to use the Unity Engine and C# programming language. I specifically wanted to learn more on Enemy behaviours and how to make a game that is fun to play. Some struggles I had were making my own sprites for the environment, players and enemies as I have never been the artistic type. So far I have successfully add a main menu, finished the player controller, added a health system, added an enemy behaviour, added a sound effect system, added bullet FX and finished the first level.

## Some short term goals I have are:

<ul>
<li><s>Finish second level</s></li>
<li><s>Create an enemy sprite</s></li>
<li><s>Add a pause menu</s></li>
<li><s>Add a game over screen</s></li>
<li><s>Create boss sprite and behaviour</s></li>
</ul>

# Second Post:

I have added an Enemy Sprite and a Boss Sprite. I have also added a pause menu and a game over screen. I have also added a title screen a system to track how many kills the player has. I have nearly finsihed the second level. A big roadblock I am hitting is my artistic inability to counteract it I plan on hitting it as hard as i can and spending a few days on sprites alone to get them to a level I am happy with. I plan on changing the player sprite to have floating hands/gun reminiscent of Enter The Gungeon. 

#### Known Issues:

<ul>
<li><s>Boss doesnt spawn sometimes</s></li>
<li>Title-Screen looks like shit</li>
<li>Title-Screen doesnt work in WebGL</li>
</ul>

## Some short term goals I have are:

<ul>
<li><s>Redo Almost All Sprites</s></li>
<li><s>Change Player Model</s></li>  
<li><s>Finish second level</s></li>
<li><s>Finish third level</s></li>
<li>Finish fourth level</li>
</ul>

# Third Post:

I added a new character sprite and revamped animations and the shooting system so it feels better for the player. One of the main things I hoped to add was a range d enemy so I went and added a skeleton that throws bones at the player and retreats when the player approches. This led me to adding a healthpool and corresponding health bar for the player because when I was game testing the enemy projectiles instantly killing the player was jarring and unfair. I plan on polishing environmental sprites and objects and adding a background. After I finish that I will add lots of new levels and a level selector.

## Some short term goals I have are:

<ul>
<li>Polish Environment</li>
<li>Finish fourth level</li>
<li>Finish fifth level</li>
<li>Add Background</li>
</ul>

# Fourth Post:

I have accomplished zero goals since my last post. I have been struggling with creating Ideas on levels and been feeling un-motivated to work on the game. Since the last post I have added 4 new guns: A shotgun, a machine pistol, a sniper rifle and a grenade launcher. So far they unlock as you progress through the game. I hope to create an animation screen for unlocking the wepons whenever you unlock them after the level. I need to create a more robust weapon switching system aswell as a tutorial for the game. Something im proud of is the new spawning script it uses a weighted algorithm to spawn the two enemy types randomly.
Here are photos of all the weapons in the game so far.

## Some short term goals I have are:
<ul>
<li>Finish fourth level</li>
<li>Finish fifth level</li>

<li>Weapon Unlock Screen</li>
<li>Weapon Tutorial</li>
<li><s>Weapon Switching System</s></li>
<li>Weapon Stats</li>
</ul>

# Fifth Post:

I added a lot of stuff since the last post such as a shop/gold system and a dash both of these additions enhance the gameplay and make it feel more fun to play the game. I feel the only thing left to add is more levels and perhaps flesh out the story a bit more.

## Some short term goals I have are:
<ul>
<li>Add the rest of the levels</li>
<li>Add a tutorial</li>
<li>Write a simple story</li>
</ul>

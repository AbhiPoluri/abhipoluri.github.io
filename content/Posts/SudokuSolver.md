Developing a Sudoku solving algorithm can be a fun and challenging problem that helps you improve your coding skills and logical thinking abilities. It can also be a useful tool for quickly, efficiently solving Sudoku puzzles and to help others. Utilising a recursive algorith solves any sudoku puzzle within seconds. I also created a GUI using pygame to let you play sudoku using the algorithm to check if your input was correct. The GUI also allows you to solve any sudoku puzzle you want. Aslong as you input the puzzle correctly, the algorithm will solve it. I am working on augmenting the GUI to enable you to input puzzles into the GUI. I am also working on a Sudoku generator that will generate a random sudoku puzzle and then solve it. This will allow you to play a new sudoku puzzle every time you play.

Developing a Sudoku solving algorithm can be a fun and challenging problem that helps you improve your coding skills and logical thinking abilities. It can also be a useful tool for quickly, efficiently solving Sudoku puzzles and to help others. Utilising a recursive algorith solves any sudoku puzzle within seconds. I also created a GUI using pygame to let you play sudoku using the algorithm to check if your input was correct.

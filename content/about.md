Abhi Poluri

I am currently in grade 11 aiming to pursue a post-secondary degree in computer science. To do this, I decided to take on a variety of passion projects that piqued my interest in order to develop my knowledge and practical expertise in a wide range of fields. I was able to learn a lot from these projects and I hope to continue to do so in the future. 

Primarily I am interested in Game Development and Computer Science. I am currently working on a few projects that I hope to finish in the near future. View some of my projects [here](/posts/)
